Each Molecule can have multiple bond topologies associated with it

Most Molecules (~96%) have exactly one bond topology like this one
Molecule 57429002 has 1 bond topologies
    Topology with id 57429 and SMILES COC=NC#N
        Sources:  STARTING ITC MLCR CSD 

Some Molecules have multiple bond topologies like this one
Molecule 8400001 has 3 bond topologies
    Topology with id 8405 and SMILES O=[N+]1ON1O[O-]
        Sources:  ITC MLCR 
    Topology with id 8400 and SMILES [O-][N+]12OON1O2
        Sources:  STARTING ITC MLCR 
    Topology with id 8078 and SMILES [O-]O[N+]1=[N+]([O-])O1
        Sources:  MLCR 

The "source" field gives information about these multiple topologies
"source" is an integer which is a bit field of several values from
dataset_pb2.BondTopology.SourceType

The most important bit to check is SOURCE_STARTING
This bit is set on the topology used during initial geometry generation
You check this bit with code like
bt.source & dataset_pb2.BondTopology.SOURCE_STARTING

The other three bits are related to the three methods we have for 
matching a topology to the geometry of the Molecule.
Please see the manuscript for details on these methods.
The three bits are:
Initial Topology Criteria: dataset_pb2.BondTopology.SOURCE_ITC
Meng Lewis Covalent Radii: dataset_pb2.BondTopology.SOURCE_MLCR
Cambridge Structural Database: dataset_pb2.BondTopology.SOURCE_CSD

One further note, the same topology id can be present multiple times
For example, consider good old benzene
Molecule 79488001 has 2 bond topologies
    Topology with id 79488 and SMILES C1=CC=CC=C1
        Sources:  ITC MLCR CSD 
    Topology with id 79488 and SMILES C1=CC=CC=C1
        Sources:  STARTING ITC MLCR CSD 
These are the two kekulized forms of benzene
While the final graphs are isomorphic, for a given pair of carbons, the bond types are switched
The first bond topology has
atom_a: 1
atom_b: 3
bond_type: BOND_DOUBLE
and the second bond topology has
atom_a: 1
atom_b: 3
bond_type: BOND_SINGLE

There are also some cases with a mix of same and different ids, like this
Molecule 3177001 has 3 bond topologies
    Topology with id 3177 and SMILES C1N2NN1O2
        Sources:  STARTING ITC MLCR 
    Topology with id 2805 and SMILES [O-][N+]12CN1N2
        Sources:  ITC 
    Topology with id 2805 and SMILES [O-][N+]12CN1N2
        Sources:  ITC
