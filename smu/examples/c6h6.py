"""More complex example processing all isomers of C6H6.

This example will use more python features and idioms than the other examples.
If you are not comfortable with python and just want to get some data out
of SMU, the other examples are easier to work from.

This will produce information on the dipole moment for the lowest energy
(enthalpy_of_formation_298k_atomic_b5) conformer for each possible bond
topology.
