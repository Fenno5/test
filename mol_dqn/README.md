# MolDQN

This package contains libraries and scripts for reproducing the results
described in Zhou Z, Kearnes S, Li L, Zare RN, Riley P. Optimization of
Molecules via Deep Reinforcement Learning; http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08678.

Note that the scripts are in an "under construction" state and will be updated
shortly. The main library functions, such as the MDP definition in
`chemgraph/mcts/molecules.py`, are of primary interest.
